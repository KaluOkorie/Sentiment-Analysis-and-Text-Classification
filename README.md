### Decoding User Emotions: Sentiment Analysis for Streaming Success

## üéØ About This Project

What if you could read every customer's mind? This project gets pretty close! I analyzed 119,000+ NetElix app reviews and 8,800+ movie descriptions to understand what users really think and more importantly, why they think it.

## üí° The Counterintuitive Discovery

Here's the plot twist: **negative reviews get more engagement than positive ones!** Our analysis revealed that critical feedback receives significantly more "thumbs up" from other users. This suggests that customers value honest, critical reviews more than glowing testimonials.

I also learned that **class imbalance is a silent accuracy killer**. Our text classification model achieved 70% accuracy but struggled with the minority "TV Show" class. This taught me that overall metrics can hide important weaknesses.

## üìä What We Uncovered

### Sentiment Patterns That Matter:
- **75% of reviews are neutral** - Users mostly comment without strong emotion
- **17% positive vs 8% negative** - But negative reviews drive conversation
- **Negative reviews get 12.9% more engagement** - Critical feedback resonates

### App Version Insights:
- Identified most-loved app versions through review volume and sentiment
- Discovered specific features that drive positive vs negative feedback
- Found that stability updates generate more praise than new features

### Regional Content Preferences:
- **Action and drama** dominate globally, but regional variations exist
- **Country-specific trends** reveal opportunities for localized content
- **Release timing matters** - January-February see peak engagement
